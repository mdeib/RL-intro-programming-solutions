# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction

Python implementations of all programming exercises in Sutton and Barto's book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf). Code for each exercise is contained in its own folder along with a readme detailing the solution and its conclusions. The code is written to provide a short and simple solution and often does not reflect standard RL conventions.

# Usage
To view the solution for an exercise simply navigate to the respective folder. The code for each exercise is in a self-contained python file and can be easily run with the command:
```commandline
python exercise-number.py
```
